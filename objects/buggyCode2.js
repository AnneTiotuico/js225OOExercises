// A grocery store uses a JavaScript function to calculate discounts on various items.
// They are testing out various percentage discounts but are getting unexpected results.
// Go over the code, and identify the reason why they aren't getting the expected
// discounted prices from the function. Then, modify the code so that it produces
// the correct results.


// const item = {
//   name: 'Foo',
//   description: 'Fusce consequat dui est, semper.',
//   price: 50,
//   quantity: 100,
//   discount(percent) {
//     const discount = this.price * percent / 100;
//     this.price -= discount;

//     return this.price;
//   },
// };

// fixed:
const item = {
  name: 'Foo',
  description: 'Fusce consequat dui est, semper.',
  price: 50,
  quantity: 100,
  discount(percent) {
    const discount = this.price * (percent / 100);
    return this.price - discount;
  },
};

console.log(item.discount(20));   // should return 40
// = 40
console.log(item.discount(50));   // should return 25
// = 20
console.log(item.discount(25));   // should return 37.5
// = 15

/*
LS Solution:
The problem is that the discount method is mutating the item object.
Recall that objects are mutable, and as such, changes made to the property of
the item object are compounded every time that the discount method is called.
To resolve this, the discount method should be modified so that it doesn't
mutate the object. Here's one approach:

const item = {
  name: 'Foo',
  description: 'Fusce consequat dui est, semper.',
  price: 50,
  quantity: 100,
  discount(percent) {
    const discount = this.price * percent / 100;
    return this.price - discount;
  },
};
